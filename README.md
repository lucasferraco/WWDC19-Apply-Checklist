# WWDC19-Apply-Checklist
Checklist to apply to a scholarship to WWDC19!

The main idea of this is to not left this **really important** part of for the last minute. ⏰
The checklist is separated and ordered by the apllication order (drop menus options are not included here).

Copy this to wherever you will see every day so that you won't forget anything.
I recommend you left these texts writen and saved on some place before the due date (or at least some hours before).
I myself made the error of trying to write directly to the application site and lost everything due to a page refresh less than 30 minutes to deadline. It was not a good experience! 😵

I wish you the best of luck! 🍀
See you at San Jose on June
